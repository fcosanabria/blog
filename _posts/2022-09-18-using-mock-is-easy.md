There are a lot of articles and documentation pages explaining how to
use [Mock][mock] but I am hesitant to share them with new Fedora
packagers because they make the tool look much scarier than it
actually is. Using Mock is easy!


## Why Mock?

Unlike `rpmbuild` which builds packages directly on your computer
without any isolation, [Mock][mock] spawns a container with a minimal
build environment and builds your package inside. As a consequence:

- A bug in the package won't break your system
- Two people building a package on different computers will _always_
  get the same results
- All `BuildRequires` that you forgot to put into the spec file will
  be revealed


## Setup

Install Mock from the Fedora repositories.

```
sudo dnf install mock
```

By default, Mock can be used only by the root user. Please don't run
it with `sudo` and instead add yourself to the `mock` group.

```
sudo usermod -a -G mock $USER
```

## Usage

Mock takes an SRPM and produces an RPM package for a given Fedora
version and architecture. If you don't have an SRPM package yet, you
need to build it from a spec file first. If you downloaded an SRPM
package from the internet or already built it, you can skip this
step.


```
rpmbuild -bs /path/to/your/foo.spec
```

And pass the resulting SRPM to Mock.

```
mock /path/to/your/foo.src.rpm
```

By default Mock builds the RPM packages for the Fedora version and
architecture that matches your system. If you want to specify a
different target, use the `-r` parameter and press `<TAB>` twice to see
all the possible options.

and other [features][mock-features].

In case you want to build your packages using Mock but you don't want
to do it on your computer, use [Copr][copr]. It's easy, just
follow this [screenshot tutorial][copr-screenshot-tutorial].
