You have just been sponsored to the Fedora `packager` group and your
review ticket was formally granted the `fedora-review+` flag?


## Fedora profile

See your [Fedora Accounts][fedora-accounts] profile. You should be a
member of `packager`, `fedorabugs`, and `fedora-contributor` groups.


## Finishing the review

Go back to the [Package Review Process][package-review-contributor]
documentation page. We already completed the following steps

> - The reviewer will review your package [...] Once the reviewer is happy
>    with the package, the fedora-review flag will be<br> set to +, indicating
>    that the package has passed review.
>
> - If you have not yet been sponsored, request sponsorship by raising an
>    issue at packager-sponsors.

Continue by configuring `fedpkg` and requesting a DistGit
repository for your package.


## DistGit

You will maintain your Fedora package within a [DistGit][distgit]
repository. Please [read more about DistGit][distgit-readme] and
[its client tool fedpkg][fedpkg]. Here is how a
[typical packaging session][typical-fedpkg-session] looks like but I have a
different approach. Choose what makes more sense to you.

Let's say that you want to update to a new upstream version of the
package (or add your initial package after the review). You already
know how to create a SRPM file, so do it your favorite way. Be it
[tito][tito], [rpmbuild][rpmbuild], download it from [Copr][copr],
etc.

```bash
# You already know how to create a SRPM file, in this example your package
# is named `foo` and you have `foo.src.rpm` file.
ls /path/to/your/foo.src.rpm
```

Import it to the DistGit

```bash
# You will probably do this just once
fedpkg clone foo
cd foo

# Upload the new sources and commit the new spec file
fedpkg import /path/to/your/foo.src.rpm
fedpkg show

# Push the spec changes and build for rawhide
fedpkg push
fedpkg build
```

You need to update each branch, and submit a build for it manually. Do
this for every active branch.

```bash
fedpkg switch-branch f38
git rebase rawhide
fedpkg push
fedpkg build
# repeat the previous steps for f37, f36, and so on
```

After you submitted all builds, go to the [Bodhi][bodhi] website and
create a [New Update][bodhi-new-update]


## Copr or Mock

For any future changes, before pushing them to DistGit and building the package
in [Koji][koji], it is a good idea to build it in [Copr][copr] or [Mock][mock]
and fix any potential bugs. We have a nice
[screenshot tutorial on how to use Copr][copr-screenshot-tutorial], and
[using Mock is easy as well][using-mock-is-easy].


## Keep in touch

If you have any questions, topics to discuss, or any worries that
you'll break something, please let me know.

You can also reach out to other packagers on
[#fedora-devel][fedora-devel-irc] channel, and
[packaging@lists.fedoraproject.org][fedora-packaging-list] and
[devel@lists.fedoraproject.org][fedora-devel-list] mailing lists.
